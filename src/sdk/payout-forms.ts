   * Web API used when consumers want to perform a payout. It's vital to study the Payment Gateway's required contact information. Make sure that this required information is already specified for contacts that use this form to make payouts since this Web API does not forward/includes such info in the request!

   * @deprecated method: This will be removed in a future release, please migrate away from it as soon as possible.
