   * Get Gift Pass Payment Form

   * Web API used when consumers purchase Gift Passes from a Landing page. The Web API forwards information of the purchased pass, along with the buyer and receiver's details. In addition, the Web aPI integrates with the Payment Gateway service and request to load their payment form for an easy payment processing. To avoid any issues, it's vital to check the Payment Gateway service's mandatory information requirements, such as the buyer's email, phone, and address information, before triggering the Web API.
